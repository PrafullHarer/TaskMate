## 💰 How Coins are Calculated

Every task earns you coins based on a smart formula designed to reward impact and hard work:

`Base Score (10) × Priority Multiplier × Effort Multiplier`

### Multipliers Breakdown

| Priority | Multiplier | | Effort Level | Multiplier |
|----------|------------|-|--------------|------------|
| **Low**      | 1x         | | **1** (Quick)     | 0.5x       |
| **Medium**   | 1.5x       | | **2**             | 1.0x       |
| **High**     | 2x         | | **3** (Moderate)  | 1.5x       |
|              |            | | **4**             | 2.0x       |
|              |            | | **5** (Intense)   | 2.5x       |

### Examples
- **Easy Chore**: Low Priority + Effort 1 = `10 × 1.0 × 0.5` = **5 Coins**
- **Standard Work**: Medium Priority + Effort 3 = `10 × 1.5 × 1.5` = **23 Coins**
- **Major Milestone**: High Priority + Effort 5 = `10 × 2.0 × 2.5` = **50 Coins**

### ⛔ Negative Coin Rules
Accountability cuts both ways! If you fail to complete your tasks on time:
- **Flat Penalty**: You lose **20 Coins** for every overdue task.
- **Negative Balance**: Yes, your coin balance **can go below zero** (e.g., -20 Coins).
- **Recovery**: The only way to get out of the "red" is to complete new tasks!

## 🪙 The Economy: Coins vs. Points

We use two types of currency to track your progress:

### 1. Coins (Group-Specific)
- **What are they?** Currency you earn within a specific group.
- **Usage**: Determines your rank on that group's Weekly Leaderboard.
- **Reset**: Your coin balance resets to 0 periodically (based on Group Settings), giving everyone a fresh start to win the "Cycle".

### 2. Global Points (Lifetime)
- **What are they?** A measure of your total lifetime achievement across **ALL** groups.
- **Conversion**: **10 Coins = 1 Global Point**.
- **Usage**: Determines your rank on the **Global Leaderboard**.
- **Reset**: Never! These points accumulate forever as a badge of honor.
